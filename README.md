# ReactJSeasons

A small React app which obtains user's location and determines the current (summer/winter) season based on that and the current date.

## Getting Started


Simply download or clone this project and run npm start or npm test or npm run build then navigate to https://localhost:3000/ in your browser.


## Testing

You can override your your Geolocation in your browser's Developer's Tools to alter the result.
Accepting or denying the location prompt in your browser will allow you to see error handling.
